# BAScan

Based on "Bug Bounty Bootcamp: The Guide to Finding and Reporting Web Vulnerabilities" - by Vickie Vi.
I'm working on creating a script that includes several different scanners to automate the process of finding changes.

To do:
- [] Dirsearch configuratin
- [] Add Shodan option with API
- [] Better filtering for report data
